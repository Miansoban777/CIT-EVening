<h1><b> WHAT IS PYTHON PROGRAMMING? </b> </h1>
<p> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects/p
<p> Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[30][31]

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[33]

Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming    </p>
<h1><i> Advantages of Python</i>   </h1>

<p>  Here are some advantages of python:

Itâ€™s Simple To Read, Learn, And Write.
It is the main advantages of python. Python is a high-level programming language with a syntax that is similar to English. This makes the code easier to read and comprehend.

Python is really simple to pick up and learn, which is why many people recommend it to newcomers. When compared to other prominent languages like C/C++ and Java, you require fewer lines of code to accomplish the same purpose.    </p>
